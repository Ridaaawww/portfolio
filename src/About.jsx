          Hi, I’m Ridawww! I’m all about startups, dabble in a bit of writing, and—most importantly—spend most of my time coding and fixing errors (they're practically my best friends at this point).
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I read a lot—books, blogs, and, yes, even Instagram comments (because let’s be honest, everyone loves a little  drama). I genuinely admire people’s work because everything feels like art to me—especially coding. Turning logic into something that actually works?.
